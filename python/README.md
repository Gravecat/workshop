Gravecat's Workshop
===================

![Gravecat: I think I will cause problems on purpose.](https://gravecat.com/github3.png)

This is just a dumping-ground repo for experiments, general tinkering, and very small programs that aren't important enough to warrant their own repo. Everything here is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Gravecat/workshop/blob/main/LICENSE), so feel free to poke around and see if anything here is interesting or useful to you, but don't expect anything special.

This folder contains Python scripts that do various small tasks. Any requirements listed can be installed via PIP.

**count-colours.py**: Given an image file as a command-line parameter, it'll count the number of different colours present in the image. *Requires Pillow*
