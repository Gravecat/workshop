Project Euler Solutions
=======================

The files within are my solutions to Project Euler problems, in various languages I've been tinkering with (sorted by folders). These are provided for informative purposes only, though I strongly encourage anyone to attempt the problems themselves *before* looking at my solutions.

Please note: I've long-since deleted (and recreated) the git repo for these solutions, so disregard the May 2022 timestamps on the C/C++/MUF folders -- that code was all written many, many years ago. If I add any more files to those folders, they'll have accurate timestmaps going forward.
