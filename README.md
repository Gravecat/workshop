Gravecat's Workshop
===================

![Gravecat: I think I will cause problems on purpose.](https://gravecat.com/github3.png)

This is just a dumping-ground repo for experiments, general tinkering, and very small programs that aren't important enough to warrant their own repo. Everything here is licensed under the MIT License, so feel free to poke around and see if anything here is interesting or useful to you, but don't expect anything special.

**[challenges](https://github.com/Gravecat/workshop/tree/main/challenges)**: This folder is for solutions for challenges on sites like [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), in different languages I've been tinkering with.

**[windows](https://github.com/Gravecat/workshop/tree/main/windows)**: Everything in this folder is Windows-specific, and for whatever reason, likely will not ever run on anything but Windows.
